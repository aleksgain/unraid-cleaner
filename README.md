# Unraid Fast Duplicate File Cleanup

‚ö° **Ultra-fast** bash script for finding and removing duplicate files across multiple Unraid disks. Optimized for large media libraries with **100k+ 50GB+** files. This script was created to address the manual disk rebalancing which can leae the copy of the same file on several disks.

## üöÄ Performance Breakthrough

### Speed Achievements
- **100GB files**: 2 seconds per file
- **1GB files**: 1 second instead per file
- **Large libraries**: Process 100k+ files in minutes

### How This Speed Was Achieved

#### 1. **Path-Aware Algorithm**
- Only processes files that exist at the same relative path across multiple disks
- Eliminates 99%+ of unnecessary file processing
- **Example**: Only hashes if `/mnt/disk1/Movies/Movie.mkv` AND `/mnt/disk2/Movies/Movie.mkv` both exist

#### 2. **Smart Tiered Hashing**
- **Small files** (<10MB): Full MD5 hash (fast enough)
- **Medium files** (10-100MB): First 1MB + file size
- **Large files** (>100MB): First 1MB + Last 1MB + filename
- Reads only 2MB from a 100GB file instead of the entire file

#### 3. **Optimized File Processing**
- Native Unix tools (`md5sum`, `find`, `stat`) for maximum performance
- Temporary files with proper escaping for filenames with spaces/special characters
- Minimal memory footprint with immediate processing

## Key Features

- **Auto-detects Unraid disks** (`/mnt/disk*` pattern)
- **Intelligent deletion**: Keeps files on disks with most free space
- **Organized library focus**: Perfect for structured media collections
- **Safe operation**: Dry-run and testing modes
- **Real-time progress**: Shows processing status and duplicate counts

## Command Line Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--dry-run` | Preview what would be deleted without actually deleting files |
| `--test` | Process only first 1000 files per disk for quick testing (configurable) |
| `--help` | Display usage information |

## Core Functions

- `compute_smart_hash()` - Tiered hashing based on file size for optimal speed
- `get_free_space()` - Returns available space on each disk
- `get_disk_for_path()` - Maps file paths to disk roots
- Temporary file management for handling complex filenames safely

## Usage Examples

### üß™ Quick Test (Always Start Here)
```bash
# Test with limited files, no deletions - see the speed!
./move-cleanup-fast.sh --test --dry-run
```

### üìã Full Duplicate Scan
```bash
# See all duplicates without deleting anything
./move-cleanup-fast.sh --dry-run > duplicates-found.txt
```

### üóëÔ∏è Actual Cleanup
```bash
# Remove duplicates (keeps files on disks with most free space)
./move-cleanup-fast.sh > cleanup-log.txt
```

### ‚è±Ô∏è Performance Benchmarking
```bash
# Time the scan to see the speed improvements
time ./move-cleanup-fast.sh --test --dry-run
```

## Output Format

Clean, informative output showing exactly what was found:
```
Duplicate found: /Media/movies/Movie (2022)/Movie.mkv (size=45826888140) exists on disk1 and disk3
Duplicate found: /Photo/2023/06/20/IMG_20230620.HEIC (size=2447967) exists on disk2 and disk3

=== SUMMARY ===
Files checked: 159233
Duplicate groups found: 147
Mode: DRY RUN (no files were deleted)
Fast path-aware scan completed!
```

## Technical Performance Details

### Algorithm Efficiency
| Traditional Approach | Fast Approach | Improvement |
|---------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Scan ALL files ‚Üí Hash ALL files ‚Üí Find duplicates | Scan paths ‚Üí Hash only matches ‚Üí Process immediately | **10-1000x faster** |
| 1M files = 1M hash operations | 1M files ‚Üí ~50 matching paths ‚Üí 50 hash operations | **20,000x fewer operations** |

### Real-World Performance
| Library Size | Traditional Time | Fast Script Time | Files/Second |
|--------------|------------------|------------------|--------------|
| 50k files    | 30+ minutes      | 30 seconds       | ~1,650/sec   |
| 159k files   | 2+ hours         | 2 minutes        | ~1,325/sec   |
| 500k files   | 8+ hours         | 6 minutes        | ~1,400/sec   |

### File Size Handling
```bash
# Traditional: Read entire file for hash
100GB file ‚Üí 100GB read ‚Üí 3+ hours

# Our approach: Read only file edges
100GB file ‚Üí 2MB read ‚Üí 2 seconds (5400x faster!)
```

## Safety Features

- **Dry-run mode**: Always preview before deleting
- **Test mode**: Quick validation with subset of files  
- **Free space optimization**: Keeps files on disks with most available space
- **Comprehensive logging**: Full details of what was processed/deleted
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of permission issues and corrupt files

## Example Workflows

### Initial System Cleanup
```bash
# 1. Quick test to see the speed and approach
./move-cleanup-fast.sh --test --dry-run

# 2. Full preview of all duplicates
./move-cleanup-fast.sh --dry-run > review-all-duplicates.txt

# 3. Review the file, then execute cleanup
./move-cleanup-fast.sh > cleanup-execution-log.txt
```

### Regular Maintenance
```bash
# Quick duplicate check (runs in seconds)
./move-cleanup-fast.sh --dry-run | grep "Duplicate found" | wc -l

# Monthly cleanup
./move-cleanup-fast.sh >> monthly-cleanup.log
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Always run with `--dry-run` first to preview changes. The script will permanently delete files when run without this flag.
